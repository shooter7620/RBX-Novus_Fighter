# RBX-Novus_Fighter
Just some... repository for the source of this project.

If you want to see improvements made, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/shooter7620/RBX-Novus_Fighter/issues).
Finally... try not to make fun of the source code here. It sucks, I know that... but you can help make it better. :)

Note: Please do not actually try to compile the code from this repository in a running Roblox server instance, as this repository is only meant to be an easy means to view the source.
